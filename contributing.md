Contributing
============
You can contribute code or documentation to the toolkit. This document will guide you through the
process or picking a task and building the code.

You can ask any question, make suggestions or complaints at the project's
[Slack channel][Slack]. You can also be up to date of project's news following [@hexagon_kt] on
Twitter.

Contribution Steps
------------------
1. You can check available tasks in the [Project Board] or the [Organization Board]. Issues with the
   [help wanted] tag in the `Ready` column are recommended for a first time contribution.
2. Claim an issue you want to work in with a comment, after that I can assign it to you and move it
   to the `Working` column. If you want to contribute to a non tagged (or a not existing) tasks:
   write a comment, and we'll discuss the scope of the feature.
3. New features should be discussed within a post in the [GitHub ideas discussions][discussion]
   before actual coding. You may do a PR directly, but you take the risk of it being not suitable
   and discarded.
4. For code, file names, tags and branches use either camel case or snake case only. I.e.: avoid `-`
   or `.` in file names if it is possible.
5. For a Pull Request to be accepted, follow the [pull request template] recommendations. Check the
   code follows the [Kotlin Coding Conventions], except final brace position in `else`, `catch` and
   `finally` (in its own line). If you use [IntelliJ] and [Editor Config] this will be checked for
   you.
6. Follow the commit rules defined at the [commit template].
7. Bug format: when filing bugs please comply with the [bug template] requirements.
8. A feature requests should follow the [enhancement template] rules.

Project Structure
-----------------
The Hexagon project is composed of several modules. Most of the modules publish libraries for their
use by other projects (check the [Hexagon Structure] section of the readme file for more details).

Aside of that kind of modules, you can also find infrastructure modules: components used by the
project itself. These are internal modules not intended to be directly used by users (like the
[hexagon_starters] or the [hexagon_site]).

[Hexagon Structure]: https://github.com/hexagonkt/hexagon/blob/master/README.md#hexagon-structure
[hexagon_starters]: https://github.com/hexagonkt/hexagon/blob/master/hexagon_starters/README.md
[hexagon_site]: https://github.com/hexagonkt/hexagon/blob/master/hexagon_site/README.md

Local Setup
-----------
Hexagon build process requires [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)

You can check the required software, build the project, generate the documentation and install it in
your local repository typing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hexagonkt/hexagon.git
cd hexagon
./gradlew setUp clean build
./gradlew buildSite publishToMavenLocal
```

The binaries are located in the `/build` directory of each module. The documentation site is in
`/hexagon_site/build`.

To work more comfortable, you can define some useful aliases like:

```bash
alias gw='./gradlew'
```

Other useful Gradle commands (assuming `alias gw='./gradlew'`) are:

* Help: `gw help`
* Tasks: `gw tasks`
* Module Tasks: `gw [module:]tasks [--all]`
* Task details: `gw help --task <task>`
* Package: `gw clean assemble`
* Build: `gw build`
* Rebuild: `gw clean build`
* Documentation: `gw javadoc`
* Test: `gw test`
* Run: `gw ${MODULE}:run`

It is recommended that you create a Git pre-push script to check the code before pushing it. As
this command will be executed before pushing code to the repository (saving you time fixing
[GitHub Actions] build errors).

This can be done executing the `setUp` task by running: `./gradlew setUp`

IMPORTANT: For `rabbitmq` container to work properly, you should follow the
[Docker setup documentation] (inside the "With Docker" section)

If you want to generate the documentation site, check the [site module readme][hexagon_site]

[GitHub Actions]: https://github.com/features/actions
